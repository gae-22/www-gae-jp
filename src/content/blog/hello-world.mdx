## Welcome to the Future

This is the first post on my new portfolio site. The design philosophy is centered around **immersion** and **smoothness**.

### Features

- Zero JavaScript by default
- Glassmorphism UI
- Deep Space Theme

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

```typescript
// Sample Code Block
const greet = (name: string) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to 2026.`;
};
```
